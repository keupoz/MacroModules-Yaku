# Macro module Yaku

Currently this module adds 2 actions:
- `mod(%#divident%,%#divisor%);` - does same as `mod`, or `%`, operator in other programming laguages. Doesn't write the result to any variable, just returns it
- `trunc(%#float.number%);` - truncates fractional digits and returns the integer part of the number
